# Youtube

Youtube class to initiate OAuth2 authentication with PHP.  Mostly used in my own personal projects.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages:

```
composer install
```

## Requirements

Do not forget to create a new project at https://console.developers.google.com/apis and create OAuth Client ID Credentials so that you can access the API.

Finally, set the Authorised redirect URIs to include the redirects you will be doing in your project
